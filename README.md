# capstone-machine-learning

### Objective
Building a prediction engine that will identify author for a given document.

### Training dataset
Training set is placed under `author detection datasets` as `train.csv`.

### Testing dataset
Testing set is placed under `author detection datasets` as `test.csv`.

### Quick glimpse on the data distribution
These can found under `images`.
