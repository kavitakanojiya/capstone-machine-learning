# capstone-machine-learning

### Objective
Building a prediction engine that will identify author for a given document.

### Training dataset
Training set is placed under `author detection datasets` as `train.csv`.

### Testing dataset
Testing set is placed under `author detection datasets` as `test.csv`.

### Quick glimpse on the data distribution
These can found under `images`.

[**training_set.png**](https://github.com/kavitakanojiya/capstone-machine-learning/blob/master/author%20detection%20datasets/train.csv)  shows first 5 tuples from the training dataset.<br>

[**testing_set.png**](https://github.com/kavitakanojiya/capstone-machine-learning/blob/master/author%20detection%20datasets/test.csv) shows first 5 tuples from the testing dataset.<br>

[**training_dataset_statistics.png**](https://github.com/kavitakanojiya/capstone-machine-learning/blob/master/images/training_dataset_statistics.png) describes the data parameters for each columns separately.<br>

[**testing_dataset_post_process.png**](https://github.com/kavitakanojiya/capstone-machine-learning/blob/master/images/testing_dataset_post_process.png) captures the length of text in addition.<br>
