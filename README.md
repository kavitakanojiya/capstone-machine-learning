# capstone-machine-learning

### Objective
Building a prediction engine that will identify author for a given document.

### Training dataset
Training set is placed under `author detection datasets` as `train.csv`.

### Testing dataset
Testing set is placed under `author detection datasets` as `test.csv`.

### Quick glimpse on the data distribution
These can found under `images`.

* `training_set.png` shows first 5 tuples from the training dataset.
* `testing_set.png` shows first 5 tuples from the testing dataset.
* `training_dataset_statistics.png` describe the data parameters for each columns separately.
* `testing_dataset_post_process.png` captures the length of text in addition.
* `training_dataset_statistics.png` shows the distribution of data from the training dataset.
* `EAP.png`, `HPL.png` and `MWS.png` describe the summary statistics of the data of each authors.
